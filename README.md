# web-auth-series
Code examples for my LinkedIn series on web authentication levels, from basic to advanced security.

This repository supports my LinkedIn series on web authentication, exploring six levels of authentication methods, from basic, insecure approaches to advanced, secure techniques used in modern applications. Each file (level1.js to level6.js) contains a Node.js function demonstrating the authentication logic for that level. Follow the series on LinkedIn for detailed explanations: [Your LinkedIn Profile URL].

## Files
- level1.js: Email/password authentication without encryption
- level2.js: (to be added)
- level3.js: (to be added)
- level4.js: (to be added)
- level5.js: (to be added)
- level6.js: (to be added)

## Purpose
Designed for developers interested in understanding and implementing secure authentication. The files focus solely on authentication logic, without full project configurations, for clarity. Code comments provide additional context.

## Follow Along
New levels are shared twice weekly on LinkedIn (Tuesdays and Thursdays). Star this repository to stay updated!
